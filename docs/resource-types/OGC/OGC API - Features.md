## OGC API - Features

Pure farming OGC API conforms to OGC API - Features which is a multi-part standard that provides the ability to create, modify, and query spatial data on the web and specifies requirements and recommendations for APIs that want to follow a standard way of sharing feature data. Here the spatial thing is defined as “Anything with the spatial extent” like size, shape, or position. The specification is a multi-part document.
