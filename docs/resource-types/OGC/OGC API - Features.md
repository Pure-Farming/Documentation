## OGC API - Features

Pure farming OGC API confirms OGC API - Features, a multi-part standard that makes it possible to produce, alter, and query spatial data on the web and that lays out guidelines and standards for APIs that seek to share feature data in a consistent manner. Here spatial data is defined as geographical data. 

In other words, OGC API - Features standard allows users to work with spatial data over the web.

Pure farming OGC API - Features standard allows users to access all the collection of geographical specifications of holdings, land-covers, and plots, without any authentication. However, if users want to get the collection of items out of the APIs, they must be authenticated to access them. The pure farming API uses OAuth2.0 for authentication. So, to get authentication, users are required to be passed by OAuth2.0.
