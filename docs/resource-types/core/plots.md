## URLs

Get all Plots that you have access to.

```
GET /data/plots
```

Get an individual Plot.

```
GET /data/plots/{id}
```

Get all plots that are linked to the provided holding id.

```
GET /data/holdings/{HoldingId}/plots
```

Get a list of plots that are linked to the provided holding id.

```
GET /data/holdings/{HoldingId}/plots/{PlotId}
```

## Response Structure

Plots are a field or a piece of land that is used for planting and reaping crops. Although it is smaller than the holdings but is a quite substantial piece of land. 

A call to the Plots endpoint returns the following fields:

```json
{
  "crops": [...],
  "historicCrops": [...],
  "activities": [...],
  "classifications": [...],
  "centroid": {...},
  "spatialFeature": {...},
  "totalArea": {...},
  "internalId": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
  "id": "string",
  "meta": {...},
  "self": "string",
  "identifiers": [...],
  "links": [...],
  "name": "string"
}
```

## Activity

It provides information on the various activities performed on the plot. For instance, It can be plantation of a crop, harvesting, or some other such activity.

```json
{
  "id": {
    "id": "string",
    "scheme": "string"
  },
  "isPrimary": true,
  "name": "string",
  "productiveArea": {
    "measurement": 123,
    "units": "MTK"
  }
}
```

| Response Item | Description | Data Type |
| ------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| **Id** | The Identifier for this Activity | [Identifier](/resource-types/common.md#identifier) |
| **IsPrimary** | Determines whether the Activity is the primary activity of the plot | Boolean |
| **Name** | The name of the Activity | String |
| **Productive Area** | The productive area relevant to this Activity | [Total Area](/resource-types/common.md#total-area) |

## Classification

It is the systematic arrangement of groups or categories based on certain characteristics or established criteria. Here it is Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary.

```json
{
  "primary": "string",
  "scheme": "string",
  "secondary": "string",
  "tertiary": "string"
}
```

| Response Item | Description | Data Type |
| ------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| **Primary** | The primary level of classification under the scheme. | String |
| **Scheme** | The scheme for this classification. This should be reverse DNS notation. | String |
